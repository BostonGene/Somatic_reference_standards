## Somatic reference standards

A major challenge in the analytical validation of whole-exome sequensing (WES) assays is the lack of reference exomes for somatic variant calling to establish accurate exome-wide performance characteristics. To address this limitation, we established somatic mutation reference standards using 5 well-characterized cell lines: COLO829, HCC1143, HCC1937, HCC1395, and NCI-H1770.

## Methods
Real-world tumor tissues have heterogeneous cell content, it is essential to use representative samples during assay development and validation. To test the assay under challeging conditions with decreasesed malignant cell purity the following dataset is proposed. For each cell line and its corresponding normal B cells, separate FFPE blocks were preparedâ€”one for the tumor cells and one for the matched normal cells. These blocks were stored for 3-4 months, after which DNA extracts were prepared from both the tumor and normal FFPE blocks, as well as from tumor and baseline B cell cultures. The tumor and matched normal DNA extracts were then mixed in various proportions (0:100, 10:90, 20:80, 30:70, 50:50, 25:75, 100:0) before proceeding with library construction procedures.
